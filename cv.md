[Codewars Kata description](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56c5847f27be2c3db20009c3/javascript "click to go to Codewars")  
**Subtract the sum**  
Complete the function which get an input number n such that `n >= 10` and `n < 10000`, then:  
Sum all the digits of `n`.  
Subtract the sum from `n`, and it is your new `n`.  
If the new `n` is in the list below return the associated fruit, otherwise return back to task 1.  
**Example**  
n = `325`  
sum = `3+2+5` = `10`  
n = `325-10` = `315` (not in the list)  
sum = `3+1+5` = `9`  
n = `315-9` = `306` (not in the list)  
sum = `3+0+6` = `9`  
n = `306-9` = `297` (not in the list)  
.  
.  
.

...until you find the first `n` in the list below.  
There is no preloaded code to help you. _This is not about coding skills; think before you code_

        .map(elem => +elem)
        .reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0)
    }

    function newNumber(oldNumber, sum) {
      return oldNumber - sum;
    }

    function checkTheDictionary(newNumber, DICTIONARY) {
      return DICTIONARY[newNumber] ? true : false;
    }

    let nextNumber = newNumber(n, numberToSumOfNumbers(n));

    function recursionIteration(nextNumber) {
      if (checkTheDictionary(nextNumber, DICTIONARY)) {
        return DICTIONARY[nextNumber];
    } else {
        nextNumber = newNumber(nextNumber, numberToSumOfNumbers(nextNumber));
        return recursionIteration(nextNumber);
      }
    }

    return recursionIteration(nextNumber);

    // or just return `apple`, it'll fit perfectly)))

**Boilerplate-eslint-prettier-husky**  
Project Description:

Custom boilerplate created by me for integrating ESLint, Prettier, and Husky (with hooks) into future projects.

These boilerplates follow the FSD architecture and are built on principles of low coupling and high cohesion, allowing them to be easily combined or removed as needed. You can selectively include only the required boilerplates (note: the React-based boilerplate requires the Webpack boilerplate).

All of them are maintained by me.
