  <div class="layout-one-column multi-paragraph__container">
    <p class="paragraph-l text-light">Custom boilerplate created by me for integrating ESLint, Prettier, and Husky (with hooks) into future projects.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-l text-light">
      There are several frontend-oriented boilerplates that I developed, designed for specific tasks in frontend development. These boilerplates follow the FSD
      architecture and are built on principles of low coupling and high cohesion, allowing them to be easily combined or removed as needed. You can selectively
      include only the required boilerplates (note: the React-based boilerplate requires the Webpack boilerplate).
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-l text-light">All of them are maintained by me.</p>
